  SALES INSIGHTS DATA ANALYSIS POWER BI PROJECT BY CODEBASICS 
 MAIN STEPS INCLUDED : 
1. discuss the problem statement of how a computer manufacturer face issues in their sales { ames grid }
2. data discovery
3. data cleaning 
4. data merging 
5. dashboarding 
6. revenue , sales by years 
7. give the dashboard to stakeholders { sales directors , marketing head } and they give data analyst the feedback

STEP 1 - PROBLEM STATEMENT 

ATLIQ hardware is a company that supplies hardware equipments across India .they have the head office at Delhi and gujarat and many branches across India.
Bhavan Patel - sales director wants to get insights on the sales and know which area should be focused more , shd we give some offers or not ? 
just verbal insights on a data cannot be clear & concise
picture speaks more than words 
so creating a visual with all data put into can be better for patel to observe the sales rate 

STEP 2 - DATA DISCOVERY USING AIMS GRID 

AIMS GRID - project management tool and it has 4 componenets 
1. PURPOSE - what is our pain point ? what to do exactly?
2. STACKHOLDERS - who are people involved ? data analyst team , IT team , marketing team and the sales director . Some companies will not have these teams in house so they will outsource their projects to some other company like accenture , TCS , infosys , etc. But for this project , we assume these are already in-house
3. AIMS GRID - whats the end result and insights ? here , result is a power bi dashboard
4. SUCCESS CRITERIA - reduce cost of manual work and acheive desired results after using this dashboard for say 3 months

IT TEAM - FALCONS  { has all MYSQL database } 
DATA ENGINEERS TEAM - DATA MINERS 
DATA ANALYST TEAM - DATA MASTERS { reach out to miners team to access the db from the warehouse  }

PROCESS OF DATA  { JOB of DATA MINERS }
1. take data from MYSQL / OLTP [ online transaction processing system ] 
2. perform ETL [ extract transform load ] using tools like apache ni fi , python and pandas
3. store in data warehouse like tera data , snowflake 

Now y all these steps and y not directly perform queries on MYSQL ? 
there are 2 problems : i) may cause db to slow down so main stream affected ii) format of data in OLTP may not be the desired format

FOR THIS PROJECT , TO MAKE IT SIMPLE , NOT BUILDING ANY DATA WAREHOUSE AND INSTEAD PULL DATA DIRECTLY FROM MYSQL DB . SO ASSUME data analysts get the data directly from the IT team 


STEP 3 - DATA ANALYSIS USING MYSQL 

1 . install MYSQL workbench  which helps to view tables and run queries 
2. create a new connection by pressing the + and name as dev_sales insights and press OK
3. check the status of the connection by clicking to check status under administration
4. download the sql db given in the github by clicking on to clone and download zip

IMPORT DATA INTO SQL SERVER 
1. click on server and data import 
2. choose the file location and choose the file 
3. get imported and runs without an error 
4. refresh and see sales db created 

DB INFO 
there are totally 5 tables 
1. CUSTOMERS - cust infor like code , name nd type
2. TRANSACTIONS - info like sales qty and amount  , pdt code , cust code and market code  , currency [ some are INR and some in USD ]
3. PRODUCTS - pdt code and type 
4. MARKETS - code , name and zone 
5. DATE - date , year , month and date as yy__mm

ANALYSIS USING QUERIES 
1. count of database { count(*) } - 150000 approx
2. count of customers { count(*) } - 38
3. count of transactions at chennai alone { marketcode is 001 } - 1035
4. count of transactions with currency as USD  - 2 
5. INNER join on date of date table and transactions table { refer word } and then fetch transactions at the year 2020
6. sum of sales at 2020 [  no USD at 2020 , so no worries ] - 152 Million
7. sum of sales at 2019 - 336 M [ so revenue is declining ]
8. sum of sales at chennai during 2020 { refer word } - 2.4M
9. distinct product list sold at chennai { refer word }


STEP 4 - PULL DATA INTO POWER BI AND DO DATA CLEANING 
{ this is also called ETL }
 
Extract data from MYSQL database and connect to power bi 
Check for relationships between the tables { same clmn names form a relationships }
manually connect some relationships  
These are called "star schema"

STAR SCHEMA - concept in the world of data warehousing and analytics which has two types of tables : fact tables and dimension tables 
fact table - actual transaction / actual events happening in the business
dim table - cust details , pdt , market and so on
dim tables connect with fact tables to form relationships in shape of a star 
In our star schema , transactions is the fact table and other are dim tables 

DATA CLEANING / TRANSFORMATION  { done at power query editor }

Go to transform data and open power query editor 
1. markets - Atliq does business only in india , but our markets table has values of new york and paris . so remove that . so go to zone and choose blank and click ok to remove empty values 
2. transactions -   remove sales amt that is 0 nd -1 
3. transactions - convert USD to INR  by applying an if condition  { 1 USD = 75 INR  as of this project ,but in reality there will be a currency conversion table and we pull data from that and multiply }
4. transactions - remove duplicate records { INR , INR\r , USD , USD\r}  so INR\r and USD\r are the real records as they are more in number  . so remove the other 2 currencies 

STEP 5 - BUILDING DASHBOARD

CREATING BASE MEASURE TABLE AND FOLLOWING MEASURES 
1. Revenue - sum of sales amount
2. Sales Qty - sum of sales quantity
